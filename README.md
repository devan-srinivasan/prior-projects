# Prior Projects
This repository represents my projects prior to officially using GitHub to maintain projects.
Since the projects are small and weren't maintained using GitHub I have compiled them into one repository for **viewing**, although I am aware that working projects should be kept in their own repository. Please consider this as a display case, so that whomever is interested can view all my past projects in one easy location. After the development of these projects, I have since created new repositories for every project I create or contribute to, viewable on the *pinned* section of my profile.
