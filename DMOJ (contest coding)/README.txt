DMOJ problems were worked on by me and my colleague and friend Ali Orozgani. Throughout our journey we learned
many different data structures and algorithms (some of which aren't featured in these problems because they were 
unfortunately lost) such as:
- graphs and associated algorithms (searching, traversal, djikstra)
- heaps, queues, stacks and basic algorithms to use these including a heap sort
- sorting (binary sort, quicksort, insertion, swap, bubble)
- recursion (breadth first search, depth first search)
- greedy algorithms
- dynamic programming
- string algorithms (finding substrings)
